# React Codes

ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UI) or front-end applications. It was created by Facebook and is now maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React allows developers to create reusable UI components that can be combined to form complex user interfaces. It uses a declarative approach to describe how the UI should look based on the current state of the application. This means that developers can focus on the logic of their application rather than worrying about the details of how the UI is updated.

React is used by many large companies, including Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, and Airbnb, and has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its ongoing development and improvement.

Being open source means that React is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute, and the community is encouraged to contribute bug fixes and new features to the project. This allows React to evolve rapidly and stay at the forefront of front-end development.
